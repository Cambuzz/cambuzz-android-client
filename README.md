# Cambuzz-android-client
This repository contains the android client of [Cambuzz Vitcc](http://www.cambuzz.co.in/). This app connects the Cambuzz user directly to the Buzz feed of Cambuzz - Ongoing events, upcoming competitions, fresh news, roumours and a lot more. It also provides with the module of 'Track Your Teacher', where student's can check whether a particular faculty is free or not at the moment or what are their free slots. Not only that, they get the cabin location details of that faculty
